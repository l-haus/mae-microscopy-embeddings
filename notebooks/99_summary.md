## Conclusion

In this notebook, we explored the behavior of pretrained Masked Autoencoder (MAE) embeddings on real microscopy images using a subset of BBBC006. We began by normalizing and inspecting the raw data, highlighting issues such as blur and illumination variability common in biological imaging.

Using a ViT-MAE model from Hugging Face, we extracted patch-based embeddings and pooled them to obtain compact representations of each image. We visualized these embeddings with cosine similarity and t-SNE, revealing a variety of structures even in the absence of ground-truth labels.

To probe robustness, we applied Gaussian noise to the input images and analyzed how much the resulting embeddings shifted. Both quantitative (L2 drift) and visual (t-SNE) analyses showed that even small input perturbations can significantly affect the embedding space â€” a key consideration for downstream tasks like retrieval, classification, and validation in regulated domains.

## Next Steps

- Benchmarking across pretrained transformer-based vision models (e.g., ViT, MAE variants)
- Evaluating robustness to input perturbations (blur, brightness shifts, cropping)
- Analyzing embedding drift under biological and technical variability
- Integrating similarity search with FAISS for prototype semantic retrieval
- Exploring t-SNE and clustering behavior across deeper z-stacks and other imaging modalities
- Investigating patch-wise attribution or interpretability tools for embedding diagnostics
